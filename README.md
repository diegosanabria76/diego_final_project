# diego_final_project
How to Install my project:
In any python IDE, but I found Anaconda very useful because if you try something like Pycharm, the libraries (Time, Pandas and Numpy.) wont be  downloaded, so that will be extra work.
But you only need select the error message and right click and libraries will be installed in most of the available IDE.
You can fork or copy my code from:

How to Use my project:
The menu will ask user for a city, so it is important to enter an integer according to the city you want to see data. The options are 1 for Chicago, 2 for New York or 3 for Washington.


I also follow some information about loops, my main source of info was of course Udacity due to some code and the methods for the filters were already there, then I went to W3schools, Stack overflow and the Python org.
